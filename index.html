Exploring has been powered by questions, and now we are captivated with another question on: Are we alone in the vast universe? Our recent sights have turned to Mars: our best bet of finding ancient life forms.

This research could provide useful information to eventually hold a man-held space mission to Mars. Until then, let’s see what surprises Perseverance will uncover! </p>
